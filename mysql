                                                                   Sql
                                                 # it is not serverless
                                                 # by default one backup for server is always created
          Go to console->SQL->create instance->choose(mysql,postgresql,mysql server)
          Important Note: In order to create table in databases(which you will create from console) you have to use cloud shell. Table inside databases cant be created from console
          
                       Users:go to console->
                       By default root user is always there
                       Creating users-users-> create user with password for accessing sql server(in my case user1 and password)
                    
                       Databases: Users will have access to databases, you can create databases from console but connect through cloud     shell using user1 you created
                       
                       Connect to sql from cloud shell
                      1) First off enable API-Cloud SQL Admin API
                       2) connect in shell command 
                       gcloud sql connect my-first-sql --user=user1 --quiet
                       3)Will ask for password for user1 that you created
                       4)Boom connected to SQL(just like local sql you used in java project)
                       5) you can execute all sql queries through shell(mysql>)
                       6) create table using query
                       
                       Logs->contain operations that you performed like
                       user creation, database creation, update etc
