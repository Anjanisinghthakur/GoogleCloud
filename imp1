Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. 
Virtual machine Instances and persistent disks live in a zone. To attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, 
both resources must be in the same zone.
Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, the instance must be in the same region as the static IP.

K8S:
Session affinity
The service configuration used in the lab does not ensure that all requests from a single client will always connect to the same Pod. 
Each request is treated separately and can connect to either the normal nginx deployment or to the nginx-canary deployment.

This potential to switch between different versions may cause problems if there are significant changes in functionality in the canary release. 
To prevent this you can set the sessionAffinity field to ClientIP in the specification of the service if you need a client's first request to determine which Pod will be used for all subsequent connections.
