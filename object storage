                                            Object Storage(Buckets)
                                            
Cloud Storage is Serverless And has autoscaling feature
Go to Console->Cloud Storge->create bucket
                                        
1)Buckets are like files where we can upload files from local system. Used to store files and folders in form of objects.
2)We can also set Retention policy-means we cant delete (bucket or object) for that time (8000 sec). However the bucket can be deleted if it doesnt hold any object(files,folders,etc)

Storage Classes: U can update storage class of a bucket
#standard
#NEarline
#ColdLine
#Archive

                                                          Object Lifecycle mgmt
3) Lifecycle rules: Used to change the storage bucket to Nearline,Coldline or delete if not accessed within time.
there are two things here:
>Object Conditions(like age, Live state etc) on the basis of which action will be processed.
>Action(like move to nearline,coldline or delete if condition becomes true(for ex not accessed for 30 days then move to coldline)

Action type:SetStorageClass and Delete
#After creating bucket->Lifecycle(Click on None)->add rule
#Select Condition and action->create



Example:Following will be shown on rules
Action                 Object condition
Set to Coldline	30+ days since object was updated
