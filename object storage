                                            Object Storage(Buckets)
                                            
Cloud Storage is Serverless And has autoscaling feature
Go to Console->Cloud Storge->create bucket
                                        
1)Buckets are like files where we can upload files from local system. Used to store files and folders in form of objects.
2)Bucket lock-We can also set Retention policy-means we cant delete (bucket or object) for that time (8000 sec). However the bucket can be deleted if it doesnt hold any object(files,folders,etc)
gsutil retention set 10s "gs://$BUCKET"

Storage Classes: U can update storage class of a bucket
#standard
#NEarline
#ColdLine
#Archive

                                                          Object Lifecycle mgmt
3) Lifecycle rules: Used to change the storage bucket to Nearline,Coldline or delete if not accessed within time.
there are two things here:
>Object Conditions(like age, Live state etc) on the basis of which action will be processed.
>Action(like move to nearline,coldline or delete if condition becomes true(for ex not accessed for 30 days then move to coldline)

Action type:SetStorageClass and Delete
#After creating bucket->Lifecycle(Click on None)->add rule
#Select Condition and action->create



Example:Following will be shown on rules
Action                 Object condition
Set to Coldline	30+ days since object was updated


GCF(Google Cloud Storage) files(java function etc) are automatically stored in cloud storage(buckets)

                                                            Object Versioning:
#Stores the version of object for backup, if object is deleted by accident.
#Enabled at bucket level, can be turned off/on at any time


Control Access:
#Uniform
#Fine Grained
When you enable uniform bucket-level access on a bucket, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are disabled, 
and only bucket-level Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions grant access to that bucket and the objects it contains.
You revoke all access granted by object ACLs and the ability to administrate permissions using bucket ACLs

Create Bucket:
gsutil mb gs://my_bucket_please
                                                    
To list all buckets
gsutil ls

List all object in bucket
gsutil ls gs://my-bucket-first/

Copy object from 1 bucket to another
gsutil cp gs://my-bucket-first/index.html gs://my_bucket_please/

Move object: gsutil mv

Change storage class for object
gsutil  rewrite -s Storage_class

upload and Downloads
gsutil cp

Giving Permissions
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://my-bucket-first/ 

Giving acces to users for specific minute
